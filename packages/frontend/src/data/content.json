          "<strong>What is the basis of the game?</strong></br></br><p>Chili’s Big Smasher BurgerTime is based off the original BurgerTime video game where players advanced through various levels, collecting points as they build burgers ingredient by ingredient to achieve the highest score possible while fending off villains in each level.</p></br>",

The winner will be determined by the highest score on July 14.</p></br></b><p>Just like in the original, players who complete the six levels will be sent back to Level One, where it will increase in difficulty.
